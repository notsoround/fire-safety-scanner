## ðŸ§­ Core Vision & Strategy

The primary goal is to transform the routine task of inspection into a strategic business activity.

1.  **Client Retention:** By creating an automated system to track inspection due dates, we ensure no existing client's compliance lapses. This secures recurring revenue and strengthens client relationships.
2.  **Lead Generation:** By making it effortless for technicians to log competitor extinguishers, we build a proprietary database of future sales leads, turning every site visit into a potential opportunity.
3.  **Technician Empowerment:** The application is designed for the technician first. The workflow must be incredibly fast and simple: **See Tag -> Snap Picture -> AI Analyzes -> Verify -> Submit.**
